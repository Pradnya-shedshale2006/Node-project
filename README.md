Here's a simple `README.md` file text for running a Node.js server (`server.js`):

```markdown
# Node.js Project

This is a basic Node.js project with a `server.js` file to run a server.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git


2. Navigate into the project directory:

 
   cd your-repository


3. Install the required dependencies:

 
   npm install


## Running the Server

To start the server, run the following command:

node server.js


This will start the Node.js server, and it will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in `server.js`).

## Stopping the Server

To stop the server, simply press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.
